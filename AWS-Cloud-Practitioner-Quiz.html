            {
                question: "Which component of the AWS global infrastructure is used by Amazon CloudFront to ensure low-latency delivery of content to end-users worldwide?",
                options: ["A) Availability Zones", "B) Regions", "C) Edge Locations", "D) Data Centers"],
                correct: 2,
                explanation: "Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) that uses a global network of Edge Locations to cache copies of content closer to the end-users, thereby reducing latency and improving delivery speed. Regions and Availability Zones are core components for deploying primary application infrastructure with high availability and fault tolerance."
            },
            {
                question: "Which AWS service provides a fully managed file storage solution that can be mounted concurrently by multiple EC2 instances?",

                correct: 2,
                explanation: "Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) is a managed file storage service for EC2 instances that allows multiple instances to access the same file system simultaneously, supporting NFS protocol. S3 is object storage, EBS is block storage for single instances, and Glacier is for archival storage."
            },
            {
                question: "What is the primary purpose of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)?",
                options: ["A) To manage virtual private clouds", "B) To control access to AWS services and resources securely", "C) To monitor application performance", "D) To store relational data"],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "IAM enables you to manage users, groups, roles, and permissions to allow or deny access to AWS resources. It does not handle networking (VPC), monitoring (CloudWatch), or databases (RDS)."
            },
            {

                correct: 1,
                explanation: "AWS Lambda runs code in response to triggers and automatically manages the underlying compute resources. EC2 requires server management, RDS is for databases, and S3 is for storage."

                correct: 1,
                explanation: "An AWS Region is a geographical area containing multiple isolated Availability Zones for high availability and fault tolerance. Data centers are part of AZs, edge locations are for CDN, and global endpoints are service-specific."
            },
            {
                question: "Which pricing model allows you to pay only for the compute capacity you consume, with no long-term commitments?",
                options: ["A) Reserved Instances", "B) On-Demand Instances", "C) Savings Plans", "D) Dedicated Hosts"],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "On-Demand Instances let you pay by the second for the resources you use, ideal for short-term or unpredictable workloads. Reserved Instances and Savings Plans require commitments for discounts, while Dedicated Hosts are for physical servers."
            },
            {

                correct: 1,
                explanation: "Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) distributes traffic to ensure no single target is overwhelmed, improving availability. Route 53 is for DNS, Auto Scaling adjusts capacity, and VPC is for networking."
            },

                question: "What is an Availability Zone in AWS?",
                options: ["A) A global network of edge locations", "B) An isolated location within a Region consisting of one or more data centers", "C) A logical grouping of resources across Regions", "D) A content delivery endpoint"],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "Availability Zones are designed to be independent for fault isolation, allowing high-availability architectures. Edge locations are for CloudFront, Regions group AZs, and endpoints are service access points."

                correct: 2,
                explanation: "AWS handles physical security and infrastructure, but customers are responsible for OS, applications, and data security configurations like IAM and encryption."
            },
            {
                question: "Which AWS service is used for domain name registration and DNS routing?",
                options: ["A) Amazon VPC", "B) AWS Direct Connect", "C) Amazon Route 53", "D) AWS CloudFormation"],
                correct: 2,
                explanation: "Route 53 provides scalable DNS, health checks, and domain registration. VPC is for virtual networks, Direct Connect for dedicated connections, and CloudFormation for infrastructure as code."
            },
            {

                correct: 0,
                explanation: "Auto Scaling ensures the right number of EC2 instances or other resources are running to handle load, maintaining performance and cost efficiency. ELB distributes traffic, S3 stores data, IAM manages identities."
            },
            {
